# MCP Tally API

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides LLMs with access to Tally's blockchain governance API for querying DAOs, proposals, and voting data across multiple networks.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Get started with MCP Tally API in Cursor or Claude Desktop in 2 minutes:

### 1. Get a Tally API Key
Sign up at [Tally.xyz](https://tally.xyz) to get your free API key.

### 2. Install the MCP Server
```bash
npm install -g mcp-tally-api
```

### 3. Configure Cursor/Claude Desktop
Add to your MCP configuration file:

**Cursor:** Edit `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "tally": {
      "command": "mcp-tally-api",
      "env": {
        "TALLY_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop:** Edit `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tally": {
      "command": "mcp-tally-api",
      "env": {
        "TALLY_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Start Using
Restart Cursor/Claude Desktop and start asking about DAOs:

> "What are the most popular DAOs with active proposals?"  
> "Show me details about Uniswap governance"  
> "Who are the top delegates in Arbitrum DAO?"

🎯 **You now have access to 14 tools and 7 resources for comprehensive DAO governance analysis!**
